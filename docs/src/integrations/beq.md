# BEQ
[Bass EQ](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/bass-eq-for-filtered-movies.2995212/) is a long running tradition on avsforum where folks share EQ presets for movies, recovering bass that was reduced in publicly available editions, for home setups that have enough subwoofers to handle them.

## EZBEQ
